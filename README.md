# Plasma Classification

- This Project was developed to automize plasma detection and dynamics at NRC, Ahmedabad.
- Plasma movement, size, and existence were aimed to calculated in this
project. Confidential data available with NRC, Ahmedabad was used to
accomplish this feat. 
- Various numerical methods, image processing techniques were learned. To fulfill the aim of building an end to end application we developed Web-App using Streamlit.

### Data Preparation:

- The data was in terms of video.
- We have developed a pipeline to convert all videos to images using **Linux+Python.**

### Front-End:
- As the project was supposed to be used by non-techie people, we developed front-end using StreamLit.
- The front-end shows live demo of all the parameters of Plasma.
